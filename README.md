## Contribution Guidelines

To maintain a clean, organized, and efficient codebase, all contributors must adhere to the following contribution guidelines:

1. _Branching Strategy_:

   - Always work on a feature branch. Name your branch appropriately based on the feature (e.g., `feature-kpi-dashboard’).
   - Never work directly on the main or development branches.

2. _Commit Messages_:

   - Every commit must have a clear, descriptive message that explains what was changed and why.

3. _Code Reviews & Pull Requests_:

   - Always create a pull request (PR) before merging your code.
   - Provide a detailed PR description explaining what was changed and why.
   - A PR should only be merged after it has been reviewed and approved.

4. _Testing & Quality Assurance_:
5. _Merging to Main Codebase_:
   - The main branch should always have a stable, production-ready version of the project.
   - Do not merge your branch into main unless the feature is fully developed, tested, and reviewed.
   - All major changes must go through a _development branch_ first before merging into main.

By following these guidelines, we ensure that our project remains well-structured, efficient, and easy to maintain.
